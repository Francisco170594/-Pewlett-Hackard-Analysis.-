Retirement plan

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a company with thousands of employees, some of wich are getting close to retirement. The company needs to know: 
 - How many people are eligible for a retiring package.
 - Wich and how many positions will have an opening.

And, in order to start off a mentorship program, aimed to train the future generation: 
 - How many employees are eligible for a mentorship program.

Based on six CSV files provided by the company, we'll create a set of lists that hold the employee's number, name and title (among other data) who meets certain criteria, that would include them in one of the groups named above.

## Results
 
### Deliverable 1
- To get the number of retirees by title, we have two options. We can follow the instructions in the challenge (retrieve data from employees table) to create the next table (retirement_titles.csv)

   or
 - We can look for the same data but in the current employees table instead, thus getting a "clean table" (most recent title)
