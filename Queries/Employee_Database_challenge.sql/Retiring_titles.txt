Option 1*
select count(ut.title), ut.title
INTO retiring_titles
from unique_titles as ut
group by ut.title
order by count(ut.title) desc;

*Option 1 retrieves infromation from 
the table we created using the DISTINCT ON() clause

Option 2**
select count(rt.emp_no), rt.title
INTO retiring_titles
from retirement_titles as rt
group by rt.title
order by count(rt.title) desc;

**Option 2 on the other hand, retrieves data from our 
retirement_titles table, wich had the constraint 
---> WHERE (t.to_date = '9999-01-01')
wich eliminates al duplicates in the emp_no column.
